## Why Snakemake for HEP?

In HEP analysis, we rarely run a single script. We create an analysis chain: **Skimming $\rightarrow$ Processing $\rightarrow$ Plotting $\rightarrow$ Fitting.** Traditionally, we managed this with "Mega-Bash" scripts or by manually submitting job scripts to batch systems like HTCondor/Slurm.

### Key Advantages

* **Portability:** Works on your laptop, LXPLUS, or regional batch clusters with the same code.
* **Environment Management:** Seamless integration with **Containers** (Apptainer/Singularity) and Conda.
* **Visualization:** It automatically generates a "map" (Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG) of your analysis.

### Snakemake vs. LAW (Luigi Analysis Workflow): A comparison

* **Boilerplate:** LAW is based on Luigi and requires significant Python boilerplate for every task. Snakemake uses a "Domain Specific Language" (DSL) that is much closer to plain English or a configuration file.
* **The Learning Curve:** Snakemake is widely used in Genomics and Data Science. If you search for a problem on StackOverflow, you'll find an answer in seconds. LAW is more niche to the HEP community.
* **Automation:** Snakemake is **file-based**. It looks at the "last modified" timestamp of your files. If you change your plotting script, it won't re-run the 5-hour skimming step unless you ask it to.
* **Workflow Isolation:** All your code can run independently of Snakemake. You can think of Snakemake as a "workflow manager" that orchestrates your existing scripts (like a bash script on steroids). LAW requires you to write your tasks as Luigi Tasks, which can be more cumbersome.

:::{note} Credits and Documentation
Snakemake is an open-source project created by **Johannes Köster** (University of Duisburg-Essen) in 2012. While this tutorial focuses on HEP-specific use cases, the official documentation is comprehensive and covers thousands of features.

## The Essentials

To run a workflow, you need two things:

1. **The Snakefile**: A file named `Snakefile` (capital S, no extension) where you define your rules. It uses a Python-based syntax, so you can write standard Python code inside it alongside your rules.
2. **The Execution Command**: You run the workflow from the terminal by invoking `snakemake`.

The basic command structure is:

```bash
snakemake --cores <N> <target_file>
```

*  `--cores <N>`: Tells Snakemake how many CPU cores to use (e.g., `--cores 1` for sequential execution, `--cores 4` for parallel).
*  `<target_file>`: The file you want to generate. Snakemake will figure out the steps to get there.
* If you don't specify a snakefile, Snakemake will look for a file named `Snakefile` in the current directory. You can specify a different file with `-s <filename>`.

## The Anatomy of a Rule

The building block of Snakemake is the **rule**. Think of it as a recipe. To make a dish, you need ingredients (inputs), a kitchen (the environment), and a set of instructions (the shell command).

```python
rule skim_data:
    input:
        "raw_data.txt"
    output:
        "skimmed_data.txt"
    shell:
        "grep 'Signal' {input} > {output}"
```

Important Properties:

* **Rule Name**: Must be unique.
* **Input/Output**: These are strings (or lists of strings). Snakemake uses these to "connect the dots" between rules.
* **Shell**: The bash command to execute. Notice the `{input}` and `{output}` placeholders—Snakemake automatically fills these in with the paths you defined above.

### Understanding the Syntax

A `Snakefile` is essentially a Python script with some extra keywords added. This is powerful because it means you can use Python variables, functions, and libraries directly in your workflow definition.

* **Indentation matters**: Just like in Python, Snakemake uses indentation (usually 4 spaces) to group code blocks. The `input`, `output`, and `shell` directives must be indented relative to the `rule`.
* **Strings**: File paths and commands are strings, so they must be enclosed in quotes (`"..."` or `'...'`).
* **Comments**: Use `#` for comments, just like in Python/Bash.
* **Lists**: If a rule has multiple inputs or outputs, you can list them with commas:

```python
    input:
        "file1.txt",
        "file2.txt"
```

## Running the Rule

1. Create dummy data:

```bash
echo -e "Background\nSignal\nBackground\nSignal" > raw_data.txt
```

2. Create a `Snakefile` with the content shown above.

3. Run Snakemake. We must tell it **what file we want to generate**:

```bash
pixi run snakemake --cores 1 skimmed_data.txt
# if you run snakemake from a conda environment or pip, use:
# snakemake --cores 1 skimmed_data.txt
```

If successful, you will see `Finished jobid: 0`.

:::

:::{note}
If `snakemake` was not installed using pixi but with a conda environment or pip, you should remove the `pixi run` part and just run:

```bash
snakemake --cores 1 counts.txt
```

This will be the case for most users following this tutorial outside of the pixi environment.

:::{warning} Challenge: Syntax Error Hunt
Intentionally break your indentation (remove a space before `input:`). Run the command again.

What error does Snakemake give you?

:::{dropdown} Solution
This `IndentationError` is the most common error you will encounter.

:::{important} Keypoints
- A `Snakefile` defines the workflow.
- A `rule` contains `input`, `output`, and a `shell` command.
- You execute the workflow by asking for the **output file**, not the rule name.
